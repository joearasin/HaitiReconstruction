From the planning emails:
Geo-tagged Photos: I have put up a flickr group (http://www.flickr.com/groups/haiti_reconstruction/) where people can put up geo-tagged imagery of infrastructure or other relevant imagery from Haiti. This may not be the best point for it to occur (a discussion which can happen) but it does have most of the functionality that is required. There are a couple areas where work/development could occur;

    * Analysis of methods for inputting geo-tagged imagery into flickr - (direct web, email, other) - and any ways this process could be streamlined.
    * Publicizing through various sources this initiative
